# BURST
A hope for better economic governance.

Self-amending, DAG-based, feeless and eco-friendly crypto token based on the concept of Universal Basic Income, and Free Market.

Burns the used token instead of transferring it.
Dual token based, one for service taker, other for the service giver.
BRN and TRST.
Service giver gets TRST token for burning the BRN tokens. BRN token holders voluntarily ask providers to burn their tokens for their service. TRST tokens can be transferred normally. Each TRST token is timestamped by the time of the transaction(s), meaning, consumers can trace when that TRST token was formed and how many times has it been transferred, and value it accordingly.  BRN token gets added to each humanity-approved wallet, periodically on agreed upon interval. BRN tokens cannot be transferred, only burnt. Anybody can own either of the tokens.

Amending of the rate of valuation of TRST token per transfer, or the formula for increment-decrement, can be agreed upon through consensus. The whole DAG processes is self-amending on a majority consensus, whose value can also be overridden by consensus.

The rate of adding of token will be decided by consensus.
