# BURST
A hope for better economic governance.

Self-amending, DAG-based, feeless and eco-friendly crypto token based on the concept of Universal Basic Income, and Free Market.

Burns the used token instead of transferring it.
Dual token based, one for service taker, other for the service giver.
BRN and TRST.
Service taker gets TRST token for burning the BRN tokens. BRN token holders voluntarily ask providers to burn their tokens for their service. TRST token decreases exponentially after each transfer. BRN token gets added to each humanity-approved wallet, periodically. BRN tokens cannot be transferred, only burnt. Anybody can own either of the tokens.
